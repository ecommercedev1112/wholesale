While animal collagen does have its advantages, it is important to understand that collagen synthesis is a complex process that involves multiple factors. Silica, a mineral abundantly found in nature, plays a crucial role in supporting collagen synthesis by facilitating the cross-linking of collagen fibers. Silica-based supplements can provide the necessary building blocks for collagen production, contributing to the maintenance of healthy bones, joints, skin.<\/p>",
