Silica is required to produce collagen, as well as vital molecules such as elastin, keratin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), critical proteins that are fundamental for the maintenance of connective tissues.<br\/><br\/>This includes enhancing the density and resilience of bones, boosting hair strength, improving skin elasticity, and reinforcing nail structure. <br\/><br\/>A fun insight from our customer feedback: our brand testimonials consistently report significant nail hardening, along with a marked reduction in brittleness—a change that our customers frequently emphasize in their reviews. <\/p>",

A deficiency in this vital mineral often manifests through visible changes in appearance, affecting how you look and feel. Historically, our diets provided significantly more silica—up to ten times today's amounts—making deficiencies increasingly common.<br\/><br\/>Our bodies are in a constant state of renewal, shedding and regenerating tissues like skin and hair daily. Science has shown that this natural cycle leads to a gradual decrease in silica levels by about 1% each year, a trend that becomes more pronounced after the age of 35.<br\/><br\/>To counteract this decline, silica supplementation is often necessary to sustain optimal health. <\/p>",
